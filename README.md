# Get start Basic Regression with sklearn
## This project is beginer guild to make machine learning model with sklearn
This is notebook link: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/kiattiphumsuwanarsa/basic-regression-with-sklearn](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kiattiphumsuwanarsa/basic-regression-with-sklearn)

## Topics in this notebook are include
1. Overview process of making machine learning
2. Data Preprocessing with OneHotEncoder, SimpleImputer, and StandardScaler
3. Data Splitting into train and test and using cross_val_score with KFold
4. Model Training
5. Hyperparameter tuing with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
6. Using pipeline

## What you will learn
The first session involves creating a machine learning model without a pipeline to provide an overview of the process. <br>
In the second session, we will demonstrate how to apply a pipeline to streamline and integrate all processes from the first session

## Model
* RandomForestRegressor

## Cleaning data with
* OneHotEncoder
* SimpleImputer
* StandardScaler (Applying StandardScaler may not be beneficial in this case, given that the model is a tree-based model (RandomForestRegressor))

## Want next?
to make more accuracy you can do following these
* change model (suggestion XGBoost)
* play with more hyperparameter tunning thorugh GridSearchCV
